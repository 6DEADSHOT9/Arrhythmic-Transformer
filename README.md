## Introduction
Arrhythmia detection is an important task in cardiology that involves identifying irregularities in heart rhythms using ECG recordings. This project explores the use of a Transformer-based architecture combined with a dense network for accurate arrhythmia classification. The model leverages the temporal dependencies and patterns within ECG sequences to capture key features associated with different arrhythmias.

## Requirements
 - Python 3.x
 - TensorFlow
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
For detailed package requirements, please refer to the requirements.txt file.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Ensure that you have the necessary ECG dataset available for training and testing.
